## 🔧 Configuration

### File Configuration

A `config.cfg` file is created in `BepInEx\config` after the initial run. This allows you to:

- Adjust the frequency of chests, printers, and scrappers spawning on the map.
- Tweak the game's behavior to your preferences.

### In-game Configuration

Bypass the config file by directly adjusting the multipliers in the in-game settings menu under the mod section. Effortlessly customize your ScrapMode experience without ever leaving the game!
